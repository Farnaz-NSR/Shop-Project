# Shop-Project
This repository contains a small Python project with a text-based menu interface for the terminal. The main logic lives in Utils.py, which displays a menu, reads user input, and routes each choice to the corresponding action. The run.py script serves as the entry point, while fetch_data.ipynb can be used for experimenting or extending functionality around the same features.
